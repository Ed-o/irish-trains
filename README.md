# irish-trains

This is a very simple text based web site to get info about the irish rail network of trains
It is designed for quick easy lookups on phones or watches while walking towards the stations.
It uses the irish rail api to get the info.

It was designed for me - so there are no awards for the UI/UX stuff, but it you want to know how many 
minutes you have until the train rolls off - this might be for you.

I make NO promise the data is correct or diplayed in the right way.  If you miss your train based on that -
Sorry.... but you should have double checked if it was that important.
